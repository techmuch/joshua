# JOSHUA: Business Development Intelligence Portal

JOSHUA is an automated intelligence platform designed to revolutionize how organizations discover and pursue government business opportunities. It combines high-performance web scraping with local Large Language Models (LLM) to deliver personalized, actionable leads directly to your inbox.

## Key Features

*   **Automated Discovery:** A background bot scrapes government solicitation portals (e.g., Georgia Procurement Registry) daily.
*   **Intelligent Matching:** An internal AI analyzes your organizational "Narrative" against thousands of opportunities to score relevance.
*   **Collaborative Dashboard:** A centralized portal for teams to review, claim, and track pursuits.
*   **Dual-Mode Authentication:** Supports both standalone (local password) and Enterprise SSO integration.
*   **Developer Ecosystem:** Integrated feedback loop and requirements management tools.

## 1. Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

*   **Go 1.25+** (for backend)
*   **Node.js 20+** (for frontend build)

### Step 1: Clone and Build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/techmuch/bd_bot.git
cd bd_bot

# Install Go dependencies
make deps

# Build the unified binary (Frontend + Backend)
make build
```

### Step 2: Infrastructure
Start the database container:
```bash
make db-up
```

### Step 3: Configuration
Run the interactive setup wizard to generate `config.yaml`:
```bash
./joshua config init

## 4. Deployment

JOSHUA is designed as a **Single Binary Deployment**. The React frontend is embedded into the Go binary.

1.  **Build:** Run `make build` to generate the `joshua` binary.
2.  **Deploy:** Copy `joshua` and `config.yaml` to your server.
3.  **Run:** Execute `./joshua serve`.
    *   *Production Tip:* Use a systemd service or Docker container to keep it running.
    *   *Env Vars:* Configuration can be overridden with environment variables (see `config.go`).
